This repository contains the basic backbones to the python version of the avalanche analysis code along with a close-to-criticality simulation so you can confirm your results fit the mean field predictions.

To get a feel of how the code works we have provided some simulated sample data. Take this data and pipe it through getslips to identify the events (use 0:len(data) as your time vector) and then put the identified events into getcumdist. Feel free to play around with the parameters and take a look at the other code.
